## Connected Tree

This is a WIP simple UI for interactively constructing connected trees (typically just two) of arbitary nodes. The top inverted tree shares a root with the bottom tree (a graph, really). Node shapes can be toggled, edges between them easily drawn, nodes attributes edited (including deleted), and nodes created.
